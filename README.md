🌐 Bypass government censorship with Cloudflare WARP and Tor — made by a blind developer for the freedom of others.

`khw-free-tunnel` is a privacy-focused internet unlocker for Windows.  
It tries to connect using **Cloudflare WARP** first, and if that fails (blocked, restricted, or offline), it automatically falls back to the **Tor network**.

This tool was created to help people in Myanmar and around the world regain access to blocked websites and protect their online freedom.
